# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

![BBB](bacteria.jpg)

An interactive dashboard to explore Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

The dataset provided in .json format shows a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


The data was prepared and already pre-sorted when provided. Plotly.js was used to create all the visualizations (graphs) in JavaScript. The dashboard has been deployed using Github pages.
